    "ml_task_type": "Wine Quality Score Classification (Multi-Class Classification)",
    "Problem_description": "The goal is to predict the quality score of wine samples based on their physicochemical properties such as acidity, residual sugar, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content. The quality score ranges from 1 to 10, and the task involves analyzing how these chemical properties influence wine quality and classifying the wine into its respective quality score."
